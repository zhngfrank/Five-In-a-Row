package server;


/*
Client connection requests are queued at the port, so the server must accept the connections sequentially. However, the server can service them simultaneously through the use of threads—one thread per each client connection.

The basic flow of logic in such a server is this:

while (true) {
    accept a connection;
    create a thread to deal with the client;
}
The thread reads from and writes to the client connection as necessary.

Original code in this file came from DateServer.java from the class resources page.
